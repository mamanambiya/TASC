## Abstract

This recommendation establishes the role and principles of Product Owners for GA4GH standards and policy development. It applies software product management discipline to ensure standards are developed strategically, aligned with user needs, and avoid scope creep. The document defines Product Owner responsibilities, reporting structures, term limits, and oversight mechanisms to ensure each GA4GH standard has dedicated leadership guiding its development from conception to long-term maintenance.

## **Background: Fundamentals of Software Product Management**

Software Product Management is a critical discipline that ensures software products are developed and evolve in alignment with strategic goals and user needs. It serves as the hub that connects the product’s go-to-market strategy, user needs, and technology development. It also ensures that an organization builds the **right product** for the **right people** at the **right time**. The following are product management elements and principles to be implemented for standards and policies development by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH). 

**Key Elements of Effective Software Product Management:**

1. **The GA4GH Product Owner (PO)** plays a key role in this process, acting as the central point of contact for a product. The core function of the PO is to own the product's success from conception to launch and beyond. The PO is responsible for setting a clear product vision and roadmap, gathering and prioritizing feature requests, and guiding the product through iterative development cycles with a technically diverse Scrum team.  
2. **Product Vision and Roadmap:** The PO defines and communicates a clear vision for the product's future, ensuring alignment with strategic objectives. This vision is translated into a roadmap that outlines the product's development trajectory over time.  
3. **Feature Prioritization and Iterative Development:** Effective product management involves taking in feature requests from various stakeholders but making strategic decisions about what gets built based on value, feasibility, and impact. Iterative development allows for continuous improvement and adaptability to changing needs and environments.  
4. **Dedicated Leadership and Focus:** A Product Owner ensures the product does not become an "albatross"—a cumbersome, unfocused tool resulting from fragmented decision-making or saying "yes" to every request. By having a thoughtful point of contact, the product remains strategically aligned and avoids the pitfalls of haphazard multiparty design or overly flat authority structures.  
5. **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** The PO works closely with a diverse Scrum team, which includes developers, designers, testers, and other stakeholders, to ensure the product is developed efficiently and meets user needs. The PO's role as a liaison helps to align technical, business, and user perspectives.

### **Applying Product Management Principles to GA4GH Product Development**

Standards organizations that develop and implement new policies and standards for science can benefit significantly from the principles of software product management. Similar to software products, each standard or policy is a "product" that requires thoughtful development, iteration, and strategic direction.

**Assigning Product Owners for GA4GH Products on Standards & Policies**

1. **Product Owners for GA4GH Products:** Each standard or policy should have at least one dedicated Product Owner responsible for guiding its development, ensuring strategic alignment, and preventing scope creep. The Product Owner will work closely with Workstream Leads to set the roadmap and direction for both the individual standards and the broader workstream. At times, Workstream Leads may serve as Product Owners. The product owners(s) should be set upon product approval.  
2. **Reporting and Collaboration Structure:** Product Owners will report to the Workstream Leads and collaborate with them to prioritize and sequence product development and revisions. This will provide a structured approach to developing standards and ensure that policies evolve in a way that is consistent with the organization's mission and goals. The Workstream Leads will remain accountable to GA4GH.  
3. **Term-Limited Roles:** To ensure fresh perspectives and prevent stagnation, Product Owner roles should be term-limited (e.g., 24 months), with an option to renew. Limited terms guarantee that the standards development process remains dynamic and responsive to changing scientific landscapes and community needs while giving Product Owners ample time to deliver value in their role. Whether there is a single product owner or two owners per product is up to the discretion and needs of individual work streams, and ultimately decided by work stream co-leads.   
4. **Oversight and Accountability:** These roles will be served at the discretion of the work stream leads, ensuring accountability and alignment with the organization's broader strategic objectives. Should there be challenges that require organisational leadership, the CPO can intervene to support needs as they arise.

### **Conclusion**

By integrating the fundamentals of software product management into the development of scientific standards and policies, the organization can ensure that each standard is developed thoughtfully, strategically, and in alignment with the needs of the scientific community. This structured approach will help prevent the proliferation of unfocused or conflicting standards, ultimately leading to more coherent and impactful policy development.
